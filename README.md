# News-Engine
News-Engine with MVC, ASP .NET

We have developed a web application that simulates a news platform.

The application can be accessed by several types of user. 
The role of each user restricts the viewing and editing rights on the platform.

There are at least 4 types of users:
* unregistered visitor,
* registered user,
* publisher
* administrator.


Registered users can:
* add comments to news stories
* delete and edit their own comments
* propose new news to publishers (which can be accepted or rejected)

Publishers are responsible for:
* publishing new news
* view, edit, delete their own news.
* accept or reject suggested news.

The administrator has full control over the application.
Can do:
* CREATE
* READ, 
* UPDATE
* DELETE 
 on any type of information corresponding to the application.
 
 On the main page the latest news appears.
 The news are divided into categories:
* science,
* technology,
* sports,
* etc
 
 A search engine for existing news is implemented.
 The news can be sorted by the date of its occurrence, in alphabetical order or by category.
